Intel HEX format
================

Record
------

:llaaaatt[dd...]cc

:	is the colon that starts every Intel HEX record.

ll	is the record-length field that represents the number of data
	bytes (dd) in the record.

aaaa	is the address field that represents the starting address for
	subsequent data in the record.

tt	is the field that represents the HEX record type, which may
	be one of the following:
	
		00 data record
		01 end-of-file record
		02 extended 8086 segment address record.
		04 extended linear address record.

dd	is a data field that represents one byte of data. A record may
	have multiple data bytes. The number of data bytes in the
	record must match the number specified by the ll field.

cc	is the checksum field that represents the checksum of the
	record. The checksum is calculated by summing the values
	of all hexadecimal digit pairs in the record modulo 256 and
	taking the two’s complement.

End-of-file record
------------------
:00000001FF


Extended 8086 Segment Record
----------------------------
The Intel HEX contains extended 8086 segment records when the H86 directive
is used. This record is used to specify an address offset (in 8086 paragraph
form) for the following data records. Extended 8086 segment records appear as
follows:

:02000002F0000C

where:
02 	is the number of data bytes in the record.

0000 	is always 0 in a extended 8086 segment record.

02 	is the record type 02 (a extended 8086 segment record).

F000 	is the offset in 8086 paragraph notation (= 0x0F0000).

0C 	is the checksum of the record.


Extended Linear Address Record
------------------------------
The Intel HEX contains extended linear address records when the H386 directive
is used. This record is used to specify the two most significant bytes (bits 16 -
31) of the absolute address. This address offset is used for all following data
records. Extended linear address records appear as follows:

:0200000400FFFB

where:

02 	is the number of data bytes in the record.

0000	is always 0 in a extended 8086 segment record.

04 	is the record type 04 (a extended linear address record).

00FF 	is the high word of the address offset (= 0xFF0000).

FB 	is the checksum of the record.
